reactFluxTemplate
=================

A template for projects with react, flux, browserify, and gulp. 

This repo contains all the front-end boiler-plate you need to get started. 

To get started, in your terminal:
1. sudo npm install -g gulp browserify serve
2. gulp
Open up a new terminal window and navigate to the root of the repo
3. serve

If porting into an existing full-stack project, this repo should take the place of your current 'public' folder. 

see http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html or https://github.com/facebook/flux for an overview of flux architecture.
